def check_billing(paypal_id):
    # Dummy method, always assumes they have paid.

    # End goal is to have confirmation with stripe/paypal to check if the user has paid.

    # return "good" if user is paid
    # return "first" if its the users first time and they dont have a billing
    # return "bad" if its the user has not paid
    return "good"
